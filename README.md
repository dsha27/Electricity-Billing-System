# Electricity-billing-System
Electricity Billing System is a software-based application developed in Java programming language. The project aims at serving the department of electricity by computerizing the billing system. It mainly focuses on the calculation of Units consumed during the specified time and the money to be paid to electricity offices. This computerized system will make the overall billing system easy, accessible, comfortable and effective for consumers. In this we have two different modules one for user and another one is for admin. In user module  any consumer can register and get access to watch the account, do request for new connection, change account password, upload queries regarding meter problem or any power cut issues, also provided a unit calculator by which user can calculate how many appliances will consume how much electricity in an hour. User can pay its bills and also can watch last paid bills. If any user is not registered they can also register in user register option. In admin login admin can add new consumer, can edit consumer details, calculate bill for consumer, can watch payment details of every consumer, also can generate bills according to the units electricity consumption. I used JAVA SWING as front end and JAVA SWING + MY-SQL as back end for developing the project.
